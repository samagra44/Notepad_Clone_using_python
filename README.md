# Notepad_Clone_using_python

I have developed a notepad clone project using Python and the Tkinter library. This project aims to replicate the functionality of a basic notepad application, providing users with a simple and intuitive interface for creating and editing text documents. With the help of Tkinter, a popular GUI toolkit for Python, I have implemented features such as creating new files, opening existing files, saving documents, and performing text editing operations like cut, copy, and paste. The notepad clone project serves as a convenient tool for users to write and manage their text-based content efficiently.
